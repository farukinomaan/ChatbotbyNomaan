### 2. System Architecture & Technology Stack

The application employs a decoupled, GraphQL-native architecture that ensures efficient communication between the frontend and backend services.

#### 2.1. Frontend
The user interface is a dynamic single-page application built with modern web technologies.
* **Framework:** **React 18**, utilizing modern hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) for state management and side effects.
* **GraphQL Client:** **Apollo Client** is used for all data operations, managing GraphQL state, caching, and optimistic UI updates.
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** provides a utility-first approach for creating a fully responsive design with modern aesthetics, including gradient themes.
* **Authentication:** The **Nhost React SDK** handles all aspects of user authentication, including session management and token handling.
* **Utilities:** **Date-fns-tz** is integrated for accurate, timezone-aware formatting of timestamps.

#### 2.2. Backend
The backend is powered by a real-time GraphQL engine and serverless infrastructure, ensuring scalability and security.
* **GraphQL API:** **Hasura GraphQL Engine** serves as the core of the backend, providing instant, real-time GraphQL APIs over a PostgreSQL database.
* **Authentication & User Management:** **Nhost Authentication** provides a secure and complete solution for user sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
* **Database:** A **PostgreSQL** database is used for data persistence, with its security hardened by Hasura's permission layer.

#### 2.3. Database Schema
The database is designed for efficiency and security, with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensuring data privacy.
* `chats` **table:** Stores individual chat sessions and their association with the authenticated user.
* `messages` **table:** Contains all messages, with fields to identify the sender (user or bot) and link them to a specific chat.
* **Security:** RLS policies are enforced at the database level, guaranteeing that users can only access and modify their own chat data.

#### 2.4. Workflow & AI Integration
AI responses are managed through a secure, orchestrated workflow to protect API keys and handle business logic.
* **Workflow Automation:** An **n8n Workflow** is triggered by a Hasura Action. This workflow securely manages the interaction with the AI model.
* **AI Service:** **OpenRouter API** is integrated within the n8n workflow to generate intelligent, context-aware bot responses.

### 3. Key Features

The application is equipped with a comprehensive set of features designed to deliver a complete and intuitive chat experience.

#### 3.1. Authentication & Security
Security is a cornerstone of the application, with robust measures at every level.
* **Complete Auth System:** Secure email-based sign-up and sign-in flows managed by Nhost.
* **Session Management:** Persistent user sessions across browser restarts with automatic token handling and secure sign-out that clears the Apollo cache.
* **Access Control:** Protected routes ensure that all application features are accessible only to authenticated users.
* **Data Privacy:** Hasura's permission system and PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security (RLS) enforce strict data isolation between users.
* **Secure API Calls:** AI interactions are routed through protected Hasura Actions, preventing direct frontend exposure of sensitive keys or endpoints.

#### 3.2. Chat Management & Real-Time Functionality
Users can effortlessly manage multiple conversations with real-time updates.
* **Multi-Chat Management:** Users can create, search, and switch between multiple distinct chat sessions.
* **Real-Time Updates:** The chat list and messages update in real-time using GraphQL polling (2-second intervals), ensuring synchronization across all active sessions.
* **Data Persistence:** All conversations are permanently saved to the database.
* **Timestamps:** Messages and chats feature timezone-aware timestamps for clarity.

#### 3.3. AI Chatbot Integration
The core chat functionality is enhanced by a powerful AI integration.
* **AI-Powered Responses:** The chatbot provides intelligent responses generated via the OpenRouter API.
* **Real-Time Delivery:** Messages from both the user and the bot are delivered in real-time.
* **Visual Identification:** Bot messages are visually distinct from user messages, often accompanied by typing indicators while a response is being generated.
* **Error Handling:** Includes robust message validation and error handling for API calls.

#### 3.4. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)
The application is designed with a focus on usability and modern aesthetics.
* **Modern Design:** A sleek dark theme with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations provides an engaging user experience.
* **Responsive Layout:** The interface is fully responsive, offering an optimized experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **Advanced UI Components:** Features include animated loading states, custom spinners, toast notifications, hover effects, and character count indicators.
* **Intuitive Chat Bubbles:** Messages are displayed in chat bubbles with distinct styling and "tail" aesthetics for user vs. bot messages.
* **Accessibility:** Keyboard shortcuts and other accessibility features are implemented to enhance usability.

#### 3.5. Mobile-First Design
The mobile experience is prioritized with a dedicated and touch-friendly interface.
* **Responsive Navigation:** A collapsible sidebar with a hamburger menu and slide-in animations is used on mobile devices.
* **Optimized Layout:** The layout is optimized for smaller screens with touch-friendly tap targets and an overlay backdrop for modal elements.

### 4. Technical Specifications

#### 4.1. GraphQL Operations
All client-server communication is handled exclusively through GraphQL.
* **Queries:** Used for fetching chat lists and loading messages, implemented with a 2-second polling interval for real-time updates.
* **Mutations:** Used for creating new chats, inserting user messages, and triggering the bot response workflow.
* **Subscriptions:** Real-time functionality is achieved through efficient polling, which mimics subscription behavior.
* **Actions:** Hasura Actions are used to securely trigger the n8n webhook for bot interactions, passing user context for validation.

#### 4.2. State Management
State is managed efficiently using a combination of libraries and native React features.
* **GraphQL State:** Apollo Client serves as the single source of truth for all server-side data, handling caching, normalization, and optimistic UI updates.
* **Local State:** React Hooks are used for managing local component state (e.g., input fields, UI toggles).
* **User Context:** The Nhost SDK provides a user context for managing authentication state throughout the application.

#### 4.3. Performance
Performance is optimized through modern development practices.
* **Lazy Loading:** Chat messages are lazy-loaded to improve initial page load and reduce memory usage.
* **Efficient Rendering:** React best practices are followed to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
* **Cache Management:** Apollo Client's in-memory cache is configured to minimize network requests.
* **Bundle Size:** The application is architected to allow for code splitting to optimize the final bundle size.
